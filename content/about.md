# About Me

## ICF Certified Coach, Trainer, and Partner

### My Journey to Life and Business Coaching

For years, I've roamed the world with a deep interest in understanding people's attitudes and behaviors, and supporting them where I can. Immersing myself in diverse cultures and witnessing countless journeys of self-exploration has taught me the importance of authenticity and individuality in finding one's path.

In my coaching practice, I create a safe and nurturing space where clients can explore their true selves and desires at their own pace. Ultimately, you are in the driver's seat, and your personal and professional growth is your responsibility.

If you're ready to dive deep, gain clarity, and take meaningful steps toward your goals, I'd be honored to walk alongside you. Whether navigating life's twists and turns or unlocking your true potential, let's embark on this transformative journey together.

### My Professional Background

After a challenging time I was lucky enough to find my own voice and gain life changing inspiration from top coaches in Coaching Space Institute where I completed my coach training program. This was followed by further exploration into Positive Intelligence and our inner strengths with world renowned author Shirzad Chamine.
