# About Me

## ICF Certified Coach, Trainer, and Partner

### My Journey to Life and Business Coaching

For years, I've roamed the world with a deep interest in understanding people's attitudes and behaviors, and supporting them where I can. Immersing myself in diverse cultures and witnessing countless journeys of self-exploration has taught me the importance of authenticity and individuality in finding one's path.

In my coaching practice, I create a safe and nurturing space where clients can explore their true selves and desires at their own pace. Ultimately, you are in the driver's seat, and your personal and professional growth is your responsibility.

If you're ready to dive deep, gain clarity, and take meaningful steps toward your goals, I'd be honored to walk alongside you. Whether navigating life's twists and turns or unlocking your true potential, let's embark on this transformative journey together.

### My Professional Background

After navigating my own challenging times, I discovered my voice and drew life-changing inspiration from exceptional mentors at the Coaching Space Institute, where I completed an ICF-accredited coach training program. This journey deepened with an exploration of Positive Intelligence and inner strengths, guided by renowned author Shirzad Chamine.

As an PCC-level ICF-certified coach with a background in education, training, and quality management, I combine empathy, structure, and creativity to support young professionals like you. Whether you’re navigating career transitions, building resilience, or unlocking your full potential, I’m here to guide you through challenges and help you thrive in both your personal and professional life.
